                <h2 class="case-study-section-heading">The Backstory</h2>
                <p class="case-study-section-text">At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zen was a solution presented to remote workers who were looking for ways to improve their at home set-up and ergonomics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2 class="case-study-section-heading">The Problem</h2>
                <p class="case-study-section-text">Zen was experiencing a low user conversion rate. After about a week of using the app, over 50% their users would stop using Zen or use the app less frequently compared to the first week of signing up.
                    <br><br>
                    While this was a very business driven problem, it was heavily influenced by Zen's user problems. Why would a user continue to use a product that did not meet their needs?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2 class="case-study-section-heading">The Objective</h2>
                <p class="case-study-section-text">Research, strategize and redesign a desktop app experience that helps users improve their posture, with a focus on increasing conversion rates by at least 50% on the previous release.<br><br></p>
                <h3 class="case-study-section-extra-heading">How will we measure success?</h3>
                <p class="case-study-section-text">Conversion will be determined by measuring the percentage of regularly returning users. A regular returning user would use Zen at least 3 times a week.</p>

                <p class="case-study-section-text">
                    We broke the process into multiple components to throughly investigate areas of improvement for Zen. I based my suggestions off of my own research of best practices from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" class="inline-link">Nielsen Norman Group</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    The process was made up of 3 stages, with steps within each stage: empathize, conceptualize, and design.
                    <br><br>
                    We also worked in sprints to divide the entire project into smaller phases. That way, we could ship each phase as it was completed to our current users. This would allow us to have a pool of users to test each phase and provide feedback. Each sprint would begin with a kickoff meeting with the entire team to define the goals and deliverables for the sprint. Then two design critique sessions would follow before ending with a final presentation of the deliverables.

After familiarizing with the app and its user reception at a high level,  I conducted the remaining interviews with our engineer, Alex, who also doubled as our data analyst.

                <p class="case-study-section-text">To find opportunities of improvement and identify successful design strategies used by Zen's competitors, I conducted competitive research on direct competitors (posture correction applications), mobile fitness apps, and productivity apps with well-known onboarding systems.</p>

                            Both posture correction apps have separate screens for when a user begins a posture session, similar to what Zen currently has.
                            <br><br>
                            However, both Upright and Brightday employ simple, but clear prompts to guide the user during their session. Thus, effectively removing any barriers of confusion.

As a team, we brainstormed and walked through each user flow together. Mapping out our user flow allows us to not only assess the current state of of the app's experience, but also identify the gaps/inefficiencies and begin hypothesizing how we might address those problems.</p>

                            At a high level, this user flow maps out how a user would experience the app after completing the onboarding process. From our interviews, users found it difficult to navigate from screen to screen due to the ambiguity of buttons and icons.

                        The onboarding process is broken into three parts: the overall flow and two smaller flows that reside within the overall flow.
                        <br><br>
                        The original onboarding flow started off with asking the user: “What brings your to Zen?”

                        From my competitive research, I noticed that similar questions often kicked off app onboarding processes and sometimes the process would deviate based on the user's answer. I decided to design the new onboarding process with this “choose-your-own-adventure” approach to personalize our users' experience. This would target one of our key pain points from the results of our interviews and affinity mapping: lack of user control over app customizations.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, I hypothesized that if users were introduced to specific features that aligned with their motivations, they would see the value that Zen could bring to them. Thus, this also addresses another key pain point: users being unaware of existing customizations.

                        We added a demo section to the end of the onboarding flow after realizing a crucial issue: the first iteration of the onboarding process was too long. After gathering this feedback from the team, I took a step back and revisited my competitive research.

                        <p class="case-study-section-text">I noticed in productivity apps, their onboarding process had two main goals:</p>

                            <li>Get to know the user</li>

                    <p class="case-study-section-text">
                        They achieved these goals by only asking the necessary questions to get a user <span class="bold-text">started</span> with using their app. They would introduce other features later using tool tips or nudges within the app after completion of the onboarding process. Additionally, Slack and Duolingo included an interactive section within their onboarding process to allow the user to get to know the app as soon as possible.
                        <br><br>
                        Taking inspiration from those competitors, I removed any steps that were not related to Zen's main features (posture sessions, break sessions, and media content sections) and included an interactive demo of a posture session experience at the very end of the onboarding process.

                            Lastly, the original break session flow within the overall flow was modified to include more customization options. This also targets same key pain point from earlier: lack of user control over app customizations.

                                In the first iteration, I suggested that we use the existing avatar within the posture sessions to guide the user thorugh the onboarding process.

                                Using a memorable character to communicate with the user throughout the onboarind process was a common pattern in our competitors.

                                Daniel and Alex suggested we breathe life into our avatar by giving them a name and making them our mascot. They were named Zen, which, the company was later renamed to!

                                Abby then created the character design for Zen, while I provided visual guidance for Zen's personality, behavior, and how Zen would interact with the user thorughout the onboarding process and within the app.

                                From my competitive research, progress indicators were great ways to keep users motivated to continue with the onboarding process. Thus, I brought that element over from the original design, but updated it to be more simplified to make room for the new avatar.
                                <br><br>
                                I kept the existing CTAs and added a “Skip” button. Our competitors showed that providing users with the choice to skip directly to the product allows them the freedom to experience the app at their own pace.

                                Thus, I decided to design a progress bar instead. This still would inform the user of their progress and not create visual clutter.

                    <p class="case-study-section-text">We released this iteration of Zen to a pool of users from a company that offered to present Zen as a company benefit to their employees. From the company size, we expected the number of employees to sign up for Zen to be around the same as the number of users that our data was taken from.
                        <br><br>
                        After 3 weeks of observing, we discovered that over 80% of those employees returned to Zen at least 3 times a week after signing up. This was a 77% increase in user retention. This success metric proved that users were able to more clearly see the value that Zen brought to their remote working experience.</p>

                <p class="case-study-section-text">As the sole designer on the team, I learned a lot about analyzing qualitative data and making design decisions based on my findings. I found myself using the app frequently to really understand what our users were experiencing and learning to create solutions from not only a design perspective, but also as a user.</p>
