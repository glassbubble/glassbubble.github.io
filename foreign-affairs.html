                            Additionally, Foreign Affairs did not have an onboarding process for new users. This was a new strategy that they wanted to implement along with meeting their KPI targets.</p>

                            <br><br>
                            From our engagements dashboard, we can see that there are has been over a 100% increase in user interaction with with these features since the prior year.
                            <br><br>
                            We can also see that the options to print, download a PDF version of the article, and listen to the audio version of the article are the most popular. A third of those engagements come from the features used to share an article.</p>

The newsletter sign up page is accessed from the main navigation in the header.
                        <br><br>
                        From the newsletters themselves, user appear to visit the site again after they've received their first welcome email from signing up for the first time. Promotional emails return an even higher rate of conversion than that of newly registered users.</p>

                <div class="bullet-list-container">
                    <p>After consolidating our user data into key points, we saw the opportunity to improve user retention by targeting both subscribers and non-subscribers by emphasizing the popular existing benefits and features on the site. In addition to including this in the new onboarding process for new subscribers, we will also add a product tour to the site to target new users.
                        <br><br>
                        Thus, we will be turning our focus on targeting three primary goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve benefit communication through a new onboarding process</li>
                        <li>Increase user conversion within non-subscribers with a new product tour feature</li>
                        <li>Increase engagement within product by emphasizing existing features through the onboarding and product tours</li>

This informs the user that this process is something that they can quickly complete. They include a “Skip Tour” option to give users the freedom to not take the tour. This keeps the onboarding process non-intrusive.</p>

                    <p>I created the new user flows for entire onboarding process. We broke down the process itself into two different flows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-subscriber</li>
                        <li>Subscriber</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="non-subscriber-flow">
                    <p class="case-study-section-text">Foreign Affairs currently has a paywall user flow. A non-subscriber is able to get a free article a day. After they encounter a paywall for an article and sign up, they will be emailed a link to that free article. This link initiates an product tour, which follows the same flow as the onboarding process. When a non-subscriber reaches the end of the process, they will be brought to a newsletter sign up form.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-section-text">The onboarding starts off by introducing the features within the article sidebar with tooltips. They have the option to “Skip” the tour if they change their minds. There is also a progress bar at the top of each tooltip to indicate progress. A dark overlay is added behind the tooltip to put more focus on the tooltips themselves.
                        <br><br>
                        These design decisions effectively improve benefit communication and encourage users to enage with the product by bringing awareness to these features to the user.</p>

                <p class="case-study-section-text">Foreign Affairs Magazine was the first large scale product that I worked on. This was also the first project in which I was able to research and analyze large sets of data to derive pain points. This project also involved learning more about a new audience that I never encountered before.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm really grateful to have had the opportunity to absorb these new experiences through Foreign Affairs.</p>
